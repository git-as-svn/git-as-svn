== Unreleased

* git-as-svn migrated from Java to Kotlin
* Java 8 is no longer supported.
Minimal is Java 11 now.
* Update dependencies
* git-as-svn no longer implicitly sets `svn:eol-style=native` for files by default
* Starting with this release, git-as-svn introduces versioning for backward-incompatible changes.
You can control whether you opt-in for new features that require re-checkout of Subversion working copies via `format` repository parameter.
By default, git-as-svn uses the latest version and thus requires re-checkout if repository was initially created with older format.
* Add support for non-ASCII logins and passwords
* Deploy Debian packages to Cloudsmith. https://github.com/bozaro/git-as-svn/issues/370[#370]

IMPORTANT: Repository data exported to SVN has changed.
Users will need to perform re-checkout of their working copies after git-as-svn upgrade unless you specify `format: V4` in `git-as-svn.conf`.
