[[_ssh]]
= SVN+SSH

:filename: _ssh.adoc
include::_feedback.adoc[]

== Rationale

The SVN protocol is totally unencrypted, and due to the way git-as-svn has to proxy authentication through to git servers, almost all authentication happens in plaintext.

Clearly this is undesirable, not only is potentially private code exposed over the svn protocol, but so are passwords and usernames.

Traditionally SVN has two ways of preventing this:

* Use HTTPS
* Use svn+ssh

The HTTP protocol is substantially different from the SVN protocol and is currently unimplemented in git-as-svn

Thus leaving the svn+ssh mechanism.

== How does SVN+SSH work?

Normally when a client calls `svn <command> svn://host/path`, for an appropriate `<command>`, the subversion client will open a connection to the `host` server on port 3690. After an initial handshake as per the SVN protocol the server will ask the client to authenticate.

If possible the client will attempt to perform its actions anonymously, and if necessary the server will then ask for reauthentication.

If a client calls `svn <command> svn+ssh//username@host/path`, the subversion client will internally ask ssh to open connection using something equivalent to: `ssh username@host "svnserve -t"`.

If ssh succesfully connects, the SSH will run `svnserve -t` on the host, which will then proceed with the SVN protocol handshake over its `stdin`
and `stdout`, and the client will use the `stdin` and `stdout` of the ssh connection.

When the server asks the client to authenticate, the server will offer the `EXTERNAL` authentication mechanism.
(Possibly with the `ANONYMOUS`
mechanism.)

If the client uses `EXTERNAL` mechanism, the server sets the user to be either the currently logged in user from the ssh, (or an optional tunnel-user parameter.)

Securing the `svnserve -t` call and protecting against semi-malicious uses of the `--tunnel-user` option or even the calling of other commands in cases of multiple users for a single repository requires some thought.

Often this is protected through the use of a suitable `command=""`
parameter in the `authorized_keys` file, coupled with other options.
e.g.

`command="/usr/bin/svnserve -t --tunnel-user username",no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-pty ssh-rsa ...`

Of note, in this example the command provided by the client is ignored but it could be checked and managed as appropriately.
In fact these techniques are used in the `authorized_keys` files of most `git`
servers.

This provides a simple first way to handle `svn+ssh`, if we set
`command="nc localhost 3690"` then whenever we connect by ssh we will be passed directly to the git-as-svn server.
The downside being that the client will be asked to authenticate.

== A better `git-as-svn-svnserve`

Handling the `EXTERNAL` authentication mechanism properly without creating a new port to listen on and a new adjusted SVN protocol is not possible.

However there is another way:

We can stand in the middle of the SVN protocol stream, catch the authentication handshake, proxy it before stepping back and letting the client and server talk to each other.

We can create a new authentication mechanism on the `git-as-svn` server that requires a secret token known only by us, to allow us to pass in the external username (or other identifier) as the user authentication using `sshKeyUsers` to proxy the `UserDB`

We can then use `git-as-svn-svnserve-tunnel SECRET EXTERNAL_USERNAME` as a replacement for `svnserve -t` or `nc localhost 3690` in the
`command=""` option in authorized_keys.

Of course we need to keep the `authorized_keys` file up-to-date

== GitLab & git-as-svn-svnserve

There are two ways that Gitlab manages ssh access.

* Updating the git user's `authorized_keys` every time a SSH key is changed.
* The use of an SSH `AuthorizedKeysCommand`

First, let's look at the `authorized_keys` case.

Gitlab will update the `authorized_keys` file over time.

If you set the option: `gitlab_shell['auth_file']` in the `gitlab.rb`
configuration file to a different location, you can catch changes to this file, and change the `command=""` option to something that will check whether we are trying to perform svn and handle it if so.

The suggested config, at least for Gitlab docker and assuming that git-as-svn has been installed in `/opt/git-as-svn` is:

./etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb
[source,ruby]
----
# gitlab_shell['auth_file'] = "/var/opt/gitlab/.ssh/authorized_keys"
gitlab_shell['auth_file'] = "/var/opt/gitlab/ssh-shadow/authorized_keys"
----

./etc/git-as-svn/git-as-svn.conf
[%collapsible]
====
[source,yaml]
----
include::examples/config-gitlab-ssh.yml[]

./opt/git-as-svn/bin/git-as-svn-svnserve

[%collapsible]
====
[source,bash]
----
include::../../../tools/git-as-svn-svnserve-tunnel[]
----
====

In the second case, if we proxy the `AuthorizedKeysCommand`, and just replace the `command=""` option as above then we have a working solution.

We have two main options, we can keep the same user, e.g. `git` for both subversion and git, or we could create another user.

The first option requires that we proxy the original app and replace it with our own.
The second is similar but we leave the original response alone for git, just replacing it for svn

The first option is described below.

./assets/sshd_config

# AuthorizedKeysCommand /opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-shell/bin/gitlab-shell-authorized-keys-check git %u %k

* `/opt/git-as-svn/bin/git-as-svn-svnserve` and `/opt/git-as-svn/bin/git-as-svn-svnserve-tunnel` same as above.

== Gitea

There are two ways that Gitea manages ssh access.

* If Gitea is deferring to an external SSHD. It will update the git user's `authorized_keys` every time a SSH key is changed.
* If Gitea is using its own internal SSHD. It will run the `gitea serv` command each time.
* The use of an SSH `AuthorizedKeysCommand` in Gitea v1.7.0+

First, let's look at the `authorized_keys` case.

Gitea will update the `authorized_keys` file over time.

If you set the option: `SSH_ROOT_PATH` in the `[server]` of the gitea `app.ini` to a shadow location you can catch changes to this file, and change the `command=""` option to something that will check whether we are trying to perform svn and handle it if so.

The suggested config, at least for Gitea docker, and assuming that git-as-svn has been installed in `/app/git-as-svn` is:

./data/gitea/conf/app.ini
[source,ini]
----
...
[server]
...
SSH_ROOT_PATH=/data/git/ssh-shadow
...
----

./app/git-as-svn/config.yaml
[%collapsible]
====
[source,yaml]
----
include::examples/config-gitea-ssh.yml[]
----
====

./app/git-as-svn/bin/git-as-svn-svnserve

[%collapsible]
====
[source,bash]
----
include::../../../tools/git-as-svn-svnserve[]
----
====

* `/app/git-as-svn/bin/git-as-svn-svnserve-tunnel` should be the same as in the gitlab case.

For the second case, we need to shadow the gitea binary

So we would need to move the original gitea from `/app/gitea/gitea` to `/app/gitea/gitea.shadow`

And either create `/app/gitea/gitea` as a symbolic link or just copy the below `/app/git-as-svn/bin/git-as-svn-svnserve` as it.

./app/git-as-svn/bin/git-as-svn-svnserve
[%collapsible]
====
[source,bash]
----
include::../../../tools/git-as-svn-svnserve[]
----
====

`/app/git-as-svn/bin/git-as-svn-svnserve-tunnel` should be the same as in the gitlab case.

Managing the `AuthorizedKeysCommand` is similar to that in the Gitlab case.
